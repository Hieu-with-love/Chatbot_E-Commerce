## Completed Features

### 1. Enhanced AuthUtils Class
**File:** `app/src/main/java/hcmute/edu/vn/chatbot_ec/utils/AuthUtils.java`
- ✅ `validateAndHandleToken()` - Validates tokens and handles expiration automatically
- ✅ `isTokenExpiringSoon()` - Checks if token expires within 5 minutes
- ✅ `logoutWithBroadcast()` - Enhanced logout with broadcast support for real-time updates
- ✅ `handleUnauthorizedResponse()` - Handles 401 unauthorized API responses
- ✅ `getTokenTimeRemaining()` - Gets remaining token validity time

### 2. Enhanced Fragment Integration

#### HomeFragment
**File:** `app/src/main/java/hcmute/edu/vn/chatbot_ec/fragments/HomeFragment.java`
- ✅ Enhanced `setupTopBar()` method with better token validation
- ✅ Added broadcast receiver for real-time logout events
- ✅ Improved `fetchUserDetails()` with proper 401 error handling and JWT fallback
- ✅ Added lifecycle methods (`onStart()`, `onStop()`) for broadcast receiver management
- ✅ Enhanced logout functionality with broadcast support

#### UserFragment
**File:** `app/src/main/java/hcmute/edu/vn/chatbot_ec/fragments/UserFragment.java`
- ✅ Added broadcast receiver for logout events

- ✅ Enhanced `fetchUserDetails()` with 401 error handling
- ✅ Added logout button functionality

#### OrderFragment
**File:** `app/src/main/java/hcmute/edu/vn/chatbot_ec/fragments/OrderFragment.java`
- ✅ Enhanced authentication handling using `AuthUtils.validateAndHandleToken()`
- ✅ Added broadcast receiver for logout events
- ✅ Added 401 error handling in `fetchOrders()` method
- ✅ Implemented `showNotLoggedInState()` and `handleLogoutBroadcast()` methods
- ✅ Added lifecycle methods for broadcast receiver management

### 3. Enhanced MainActivity
**File:** `app/src/main/java/hcmute/edu/vn/chatbot_ec/MainActivity.java`
- ✅ Updated authentication state checking using enhanced AuthUtils
- ✅ Integrated broadcast system for authentication state changes
- ✅ Added `checkAuthenticationState()` method
- ✅ Added broadcast receivers for login/logout events
- ✅ Implemented fragment refresh functionality when auth state changes
- ✅ Started AuthenticationService for background monitoring
- ✅ Added lifecycle methods for broadcast receiver management

### 4. Authentication State Management Service
**File:** `app/src/main/java/hcmute/edu/vn/chatbot_ec/service/AuthenticationService.java`
- ✅ Created centralized authentication state broadcasting service
- ✅ Periodic token monitoring and validation (every 5 minutes)
- ✅ Token expiration detection and handling
- ✅ Authentication state change broadcasting
- ✅ Background service lifecycle management
- ✅ Registered in AndroidManifest.xml

### 5. User Interface Enhancements

#### Logout Button Implementation
**File:** `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_user.xml`
- ✅ Added logout button with appropriate styling
- ✅ Positioned below order history button
- ✅ Error-themed styling (red background, red text)
- ✅ Material Design button with proper margins and styling

#### String Resources
**File:** `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`
- ✅ Added logout-related strings
- ✅ Added authentication error messages
- ✅ Added session management strings
- ✅ Added token expiration messages

#### Color Resources
**File:** `app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml`
- ✅ Added error button colors
- ✅ Added logout button styling colors
- ✅ Added error state colors
- ✅ Added pressed state colors

### 6. Android Manifest Updates
**File:** `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- ✅ Registered AuthenticationService
- ✅ Set appropriate service permissions
- ✅ Configured service as non-exported for security

## Technical Implementation Details

### Broadcast System
- **Actions Used:**
  - `ACTION_USER_LOGOUT` - Broadcasted when user logs out
  - `ACTION_USER_LOGIN` - Broadcasted when user logs in
  - `ACTION_TOKEN_EXPIRED` - Broadcasted when token expires
  - `ACTION_AUTHENTICATION_STATE_CHANGED` - Broadcasted when auth state changes

### Error Handling
- **401 Unauthorized:** Automatic token cleanup and user notification
- **Token Expiration:** Proactive detection and handling
- **Network Errors:** Graceful degradation with user feedback
- **Fragment Lifecycle:** Proper cleanup of broadcast receivers

### Session Management
- **Token Validation:** Real-time validation with automatic refresh
- **Expiration Detection:** 5-minute warning system
- **Background Monitoring:** Continuous token health checking
- **State Synchronization:** Real-time updates across all components

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Enhanced Security
