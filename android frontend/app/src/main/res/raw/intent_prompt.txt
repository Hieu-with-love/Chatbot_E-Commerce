Your job is to classify what the user is asking.

- "check_order" → when user wants to ask about their orders
- "cancel_order" → when user wants to cancel an order
- "complain" → when user complains about something
- "greeting" → greeting or small talk
- "unknown" → if you are not sure

Important: Return only a plain JSON object. Do not include any markdown formatting, code block (```) or explanation. The response must start and end with the JSON object only.

Return result as a JSON:
{
  "intent": "search_product"
}
